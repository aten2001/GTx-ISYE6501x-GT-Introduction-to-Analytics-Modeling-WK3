Question 2

Using the 20 years of daily high temperature data for Atlanta (July through October) from Homework 2 Question 5,
build and use an exponential smoothing model to help make a judgment of whether the unofficial end of summer
has gotten later over the 20 years. (Part of the point of this assignment is for you to think about how you might use
exponential smoothing to answer this question.)
Note: in R, you can use either HoltWinters (simpler to use) or the smooth package’s es function (harder to use, but
more general). If you use es, the Holt-Winters model uses model=”AAM” in the function call (the first and second
constants are used “A”dditively, and the third (seasonality) is used “M”ultiplicatively; the documentation doesn’t
make that clear).

Question 4

Using crime data from http://www.statsci.org/data/general/uscrime.txt (description at http://www.statsci.org/data/general/uscrime.html ), use regression (a useful R function is lm or glm) to predict the observed crime rate in a city with the following data:
M = 14.0
So = 0
Ed = 10.0
Po1 = 12.0
Po2 = 15.5
LF = 0.640
M.F = 94.0
Pop = 150
NW = 1.1
U1 = 0.120
U2 = 3.6
Wealth = 3200
Ineq = 20.1
Prob = 0.04
Time = 39.0
Show your model (factors used and their coefficients), the software output, and the quality of fit.
